**Security Guidance**

The Dev Squad takes security practices seriously. Security is a shared responsibility — everyone working on this project must follow security best practices and maintain good secret-management hygiene. Treat credentials, API keys, tokens, and other secrets as sensitive data: never commit them to the repository, and rotate them promptly if accidentally exposed.

If you discover a security issue related to this codebase, please contact the Tech Lead immediately so we can triage and address it as quickly as possible. Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issu

For non-urgent security questions or guidance, reach out to the Dev Squad or the Tech Lead.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure.
